The Few Chosen's  (TFC) CTF was this weekend and I found it really engrossing. I really enjoyed the breadth and quality of the challenges. Along with quality pwnables which I have really enjoyed lately was some excellent crypto challenges which take me back to my favourite CTF category.

This challenge, JAM, was a problem I haven't run into a lot lately so I decided to write it up.

#### <a name="Jam"></a>Jam - Crypto - 490 points

This challenge reads:

```
JAM
Found this amazing new game! It's called Jam! It's very hard, though, can 
you help me advance faster?

18 solves.
```

The challenge comes with one python script file called `main.py` which contains the code as follows:

```python
import random
import re
import string
import sys

from secret import secret, flag
import hashlib


def print_trade_help():
    print("----=== Trade ===----")
    print("1. Flag - 6 COIN(S)")                                                                          
    print("2. Random String - 1 COIN(S)")                                                                 
    print("3. Nothing - 1 COIN(S)")                                                                       
    print("---------------------")

                pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    console = Console()
    console.start_console()
```

However it's easiest to come up with a plan if we just play the game a little, let's take a look.

Since the `main.py` imports a secret flag in a file called `secret.py` we make one of those locally so we can examine how it works:

```shell
$ cat > secret.py
secret = "something"
flag = "TFCCTF{someflag}"

$ python main.py

```

Ok so the strategy seems clear to me. 

The flag is available from the server that runs this service. If we can convince the server we have 6 or more coins. We are only allowed to work 5 times so we cannot get to 6 coins through work alone. We need a way to hack our bank balance :)

Since the game author is nice, they have made it possible for us to recover our session, kind of like a saved game. The recovery works by saving the number of coins you have hashed with some secret. Let's look at the python code for how that happens:

```python
        self.__coins += 1
        print("You've worked really hard today! Have a coin!")
        print("Purse: " + str(self.__coins) + " (+1 COIN)")
        self.__hash = hashlib.md5(self.__secret + b' ' + str(self.__coins).encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()
        print("To recover, here's your token: " + self.__hash)
```

So our recovery token is just the MD5 hash of some secret plus our coin balance. E.g.:

- `md5('secretstringhere 1')`

So when recovering our session, the above would recover the `1` coin we had in our balance.

Since we do not know the server side `secret` we cannot simply hash something ourselves, or can we? There's 2 approaches that would work here, the simple case and the more crypto challenge case.

#### Simple Case

Since we have part of the plaintext (` <space>1`)we can attempt to crack the secret portion by using an MD5 cracking tool like `hashcat.` I actually did try this very quickly with a 14gb wordlist but no luck. I found out later why. The secret was 32 bytes long so unlikely to easily crack.

#### Crypto Challenge Case

When you create a hash with a fixed secret and known suffix, and that hash is using Merkle–Damgård construction (the MD is MD5 stands for Merkle–Damgård in case you didn't know :D ) then it is possible to perform a hash length extension attack and arrive at some other MD5 hash that will validate for some unknown prefix but with a new controlled suffix.

So when we have this:

- `h = md5('unknownprefix' + 'knownsuffix')`

We can calculate some hash:

- `h' = mdf('unknownprefix' + 'knownsuffix' + 'padding' + 'controllable data')`

Once calculated, even though we have no idea what `'unknownprefix' `was, our hash will calculate as valid!

#### Solving

We can use one of a variety of tools to do this, commonly used is [HashPump](https://github.com/bwall/HashPump) and another excellent one is [hash_extender](https://github.com/iagox86/hash_extender) by Ron Bowes. Both tools operate very similarly but I used `hash_extender` for this attack as the hex output was quicker for me to integrate into a solve script.

Since the infrastructure was down some of the time during the CTF I wrote this offline against my own version of the script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

from pwn import *

local = False

# We'd need to bf this on the real server.
secretlen = 32

if local:
    p = process("python main.py", shell=True)
else:
    p = remote('34.65.54.58', 1343)

p.sendlineafter(b'> ', b'1') # Work once.
p.recvuntil(b'token: ')
token = p.recvline().decode().strip()
log.info('got token: %s' % token)

cmdline = "hash_extender -s %s -f md5 -d ' 1' -a '0' -l %d" % (token, secretlen)
log.info('doing hash length extension with hash_extender: %s' % cmdline)
hp = process(cmdline, shell=True)

hp.recvuntil(b'New signature: ')
exhash = hp.recvline().strip().decode()
log.info('new token: %s' % exhash)

hp.recvuntil(b'New string: ')
exhashdata = unhex(hp.recvline().strip())
log.info('hashdata: %s' % exhashdata)
hp.close()

p.sendlineafter(b'> ', b'3') # Recover last session
p.sendlineafter(b'1. How many coins did you have?\n', exhashdata[1:])
p.sendlineafter(b'2. What was your recovery token?\n> ', exhash.encode())
p.recvline()
result = p.recvline()

if b'Recovered successfully!'  in result:
    log.success("Attack success, getting flag...")
    p.sendlineafter(b'> ', b'2') # Trade
    p.sendlineafter(b'> ', b'1') # Flag
    flag = p.recvline().decode()
    log.success('Flag: %s' % flag)
else:
    log.failure('attack failed :(')

p.close()
```

When running it it worked first go which was helpful!

```shell
$ ./solve.py

Thanks to hofill and TFC folks for running such a good CTF with a great range of challenges. Made my otherwise rainy and cold weekend good.
